Use machine learning on Messenger conversations.

Hi this is my first attempt at using machine learning on my own data set. I'm using conversations in the form of JSON files from Facebook
Messenger. If you'd like to try my program for yourself, simply place your JSON files in a folder named 'data' in the same directory as the
three python files.

My solution doesn't currently work and I'm working on finding what sort of input/intermediate/output layers I need for my machine
learning algorithm to work. It's trying to take an input of words and see which of the conversation members were the ones who sent
the message. The words are encoded as the 10000 most frequent words used in the conversation.
